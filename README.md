# UltimateOpenGL 
UltimateOpenGL is a 3D engine intended to make 3D scenes. It's designed to be "code only". It means you don't have (at this time) any GUI to help you to create a scene with your mouse.
Furthermore, it needs Ultimate++ Framework (A powerful C++ Framework) and the IDE used by it : [TheIDE](https://www.ultimatepp.org/index.html)

Here it is the original Ultimate++ post : https://www.ultimatepp.org/forums/index.php?t=msg&goto=52755&#msg_52755

At this time, Ultimate OpenGL allow :
	Scene Creation

	Shape and Object3D loading

	Three differents type of Light

	Smart Gestion of Multiple Camera

	Auto Generation of Shaders


Things are coming :
	Animation and FBX file
	Physics
	Sound

## Getting Started and Showing a 3D model 

 :warning: Ultimate OpenGL is actually under V5 wich is still in developpement, ATM light is not handled
